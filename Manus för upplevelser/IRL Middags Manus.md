**General info:**
There are about 10 actors who portray characters from TWI (The Wandering Inn) or just made up characters.
The made up characters can be [[Människor]], [[Goblin]], [[Drake]], [[Gnoll]] or [[Antinium]].
We need one actress to portray [[Erin]].

**Before we start the evening:**
A group of people from [[Jorden]] show up somewhere close to [[Liscor]]. From now they will be referred to as [[Jordbor]]. They meet a traveling merchant and one of the group trades his smartphone for some food and a bag of silver coins (real silver coins if possible). On the merchants' recommendation they set course for [[The Wandering Inn]] on a hill outside [[Liscor]].

The merchant joins them in the inn and [[Erin]] welcomes everybody.

When all the [[Jordbor]] are all seated [[Erin]] and maybe [[Ishkr]] starts taking peoples orders. They pay exclusively with silver coins. (The coins they spend are tallied up by the one taking the order an payment. Each coin is 20kr maybe that they will have to pay at the end of the evening when the experience ends.) The food menu is very limited for initially. Maybe only pasta, bluefruit-juice and ice cream to start with. (Refer to the [[The Wandering Inn Menu]] for more food ideas)

While waiting for food and drinks a [[Drake]] enters the inn. 
He notices a [[Goblin]] who is currently playing chess with someone. Possibly an [[Arbetar Antinium]].

[[Erin]] intervenes and points to a sig that says [[No Killing Goblins]]  on the wall.

At some point a [[Drake]], maybe [[Relc]] goes up on stage and does a scene from one of Shakespeare plays. The person doing the performance could mention that he/she is a member of the local theatre company [[Players of Celum]].

The [[Jordbor]] can trade their earth stuff, like smartphones, watches jackets etc with the [[Stamgäster]].
